title: Nessus Vulnerability Assessment 

---



---


In this [_project_](https://github.com/elizabethude/webb_vulnscan), I’m demonstrating how to use Nessus to scan a website for vulnerabilities, in the most simplest way. Nessus is a popular vulnerability scanner that helps identify potential security issues in websites. It must be added that permission was obtained before any scans were carried out.

### Project Structure
- **docs/**: I’ve included additional documentation files here.
- **results/**: This folder holds the scan results and reports.
- **webb_vuln_report.pdf**: This is the report with all the scan findings and my recommendations.
- **README.md**: It gives an overview and instructions for the project.

### Prerequisites
Before getting started, make sure Nessus is installed and set up on your system, and that you have access to the website you want to scan.

### Installation
Check out the setup steps in `docs/installation.md` to get Nessus ready and your environment prepped for scanning.

### Usage
I’ve detailed the usage instructions in `docs/usage.md`, but here’s a quick summary:

1. **Configure Nessus**: Add your target website and adjust the scan settings to fit your needs.

2. **Run the Scan**: Start the scan from Nessus.

3. **Review the Results**: Once the scan finishes, grab the report (e.g., scan_results) and go through the findings.

I’ve learned how to configure and run basic vulnerability scans, identify common security issues like outdated software or insecure configurations, and interpret scan results. 

I’ve also become familiar with reporting vulnerabilities and suggesting straightforward remediation steps, such as updating software or fixing misconfiguration. 

While it’s a starting point, this project helped me build a foundational understanding of vulnerability scanning and reporting in the context of web security.
