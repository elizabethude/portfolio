## Simple Tips for Strong Passwords and Better Security

Security awareness is all about knowing how to protect yourself and your organization from online dangers. 

These dangers, or "threats," include things like phishing scams (where people try to trick you into giving away personal information) and harmful software known as malware. 

Being aware of these threats means you can take steps to avoid them. It’s also about staying informed on new security trends, so you're always prepared to make smart decisions that keep both you and your workplace safe.

Part of security awareness is learning how to create strong passwords that can't easily be guessed. 

It’s also about understanding the importance of keeping your software up to date—this helps fix any security gaps that hackers might exploit. 

Plus, there are laws and rules about protecting information, and knowing these helps ensure your company is following the right steps to stay compliant.

###  Why is this important? 

Because when everyone understands security risks and knows how to protect themselves, we’re all less likely to fall victim to attacks that could harm our personal information or business data.
