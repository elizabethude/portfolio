## Telstra Cybersecurity Job Simulation on Forage - September 2024

Datacom Cybersecurity Consultant Simulation on Forage - October 2024

*  Triaged malware threats by analyzing firewall logs and identifying affected infrastructure.

*  Analyzed malicious network patterns and identified characteristics of the Spring4Shell vulnerability.
  
*  Developed and implemented a Python-based firewall rule to block malicious requests.

*  Created a detailed postmortem report, including root cause analysis and next steps to prevent future incidents.


I analyzed the attack data to identify malware spread patterns, then drafted a concise email alerting the team of the incident, providing them with the necessary information, including the timestamp of the attack, to begin the response process.

I analyzed the firewall logs in detail to detect patterns in the attackerâ€™s network requests and identified characteristics of the requests that could be blocked. I also examined a proof-of-concept payload to better understand how the attacker had exploited the Spring4Shell vulnerability

Using Python, I crafted a firewall rule to technically mitigate the malware's spread, enhancing my software development and problem-solving skills.

Finally, I conducted a postmortem, reflecting on the incident's details, root causes, and compliance implications. This wrap-up reinforced my understanding of incident management strategies and governance.
