# HACKTHISSITE 

HackThisSite is an online platform designed to help individuals learn and practice ethical hacking and cybersecurity skills. It provides a range of challenges and missions that simulate real-world security vulnerabilities, allowing users to develop and test their penetration testing and problem-solving abilities in a controlled environment.
