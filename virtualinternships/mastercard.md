## Mastercard Cybersecurity virtual experience program on Forage - September 2024

*   Completed a job simulation where I served as an analyst on Mastercardâ€™s Security Awareness Team
  
*   Helped identify and report security threats such as phishing
  
*   Analyzed and identified which areas of the business needed more robust security training and implemented training courses and procedures for those teams
  


In this task, I designed a phishing email simulation. 

I started by researching phishing tactics to understand how attackers typically deceive users. 

Then, I crafted a realistic-looking email, mimicking a legitimate communication from a trusted source, but with subtle malicious elements designed to trick the recipient into clicking a harmful link or providing sensitive information.

I made sure the email felt urgent, prompting immediate action, which is a common phishing technique. 


Lastly, I tested the simulation to ensure that it effectively highlighted security awareness needs and curated a phishing awareness presentation.
