##   Hi, I’m Elizabeth Ude — Cybersecurity Enthusiast & Human

Welcome to my corner of the web! 

I’m a cybersecurity newbie (somewhat) with a passion for protecting what matters most — information, systems, and people. 

My journey into cybersecurity has been driven by a love for solving complex challenges and a genuine curiosity about how things work behind the scenes.

> I’m all about making a real impact - it’s a mission to create safer, more resilient digital spaces.
>
> One thing I’m particularly proud of is my ability to bridge the gap between the technical and the human.

I love working with diverse people, translating technical insights into practical solutions that everyone can understand and benefit from. 

After all, security is for everyone, not just those of us in the SOC!

Academically, my background in Cyberpsychology adds another layer to how I approach my work—understanding not just the technology, but the human behaviors behind it. 

Outside of work, I’m always learning, always curious, and always ready to take on the next challenge.

Feel free to explore my portfolio for more about my experience, projects, and the world of cybersecurity through my eyes.
