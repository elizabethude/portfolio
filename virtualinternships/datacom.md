##  Datacom Cybersecurity Job Simulation on Forage - October 2024

 * Completed a simulation focussed on how Datacom's cybersecurity team helps
   protect it's clients
 * Investigated a cyberattack and produced a comprehensive report documenting
   findings and outlining key recommendations to improve a client's
   cybersecurity posture
 * Conducted a comprehensive risk assessment

####   Task 1

I used OSINT tools to gather information about APT34, explored their history, nation-state affiliations, targeted industries, and motives. 

I also analyzed their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to understand how they conduct their attacks. 

I then applied the MITRE ATT&CK framework to identify ways to defend the client against future threats. 

My final deliverable was a comprehensive report summarizing my research findings and offering recommendations to improve the clientâ€™s cybersecurity posture.

####   Task 2

Using a padlock analogy, I helped the client identify key assets to protect and assessed different risk scenarios, such as cyberattacks. 

I defined the risk matrix, calculating risk ratings for each scenario, both without and with existing security measures. 

I then suggested additional measures to further reduce the risks and created a detailed risk assessment report to guide the client in mitigating these risks and strengthening their security posture.
