## Commonwealth Bank Introduction to Cybersecurity Job Simulation on Forage - September 2024

- Completed a job simulation involving the role of a cybersecurity generalist, specializing in fraud detection and prevention for Commonwealth Bank's Cybersecurity team.
- Developed skills in building data visualization dashboards using Splunk to uncover patterns and insights in historical customer data, aiding in fraud detection.
- Demonstrated the ability to respond effectively to cybersecurity incidents, including notifying relevant teams, collecting information, containing and stopping attacks, and aiding in recovery efforts.
- Enhanced security awareness expertise by designing infographics promoting best practices for secure password management, following Australian Cybersecurity Centre advice.
- Acquired practical experience in penetration testing, assessing the security of web applications, identifying vulnerabilities, and providing recommendations for remediation to bolster cybersecurity defenses.


I completed several key cybersecurity tasks that enhanced my skills in data analysis, incident response, security awareness, and penetration testing:

*  Fraud Detection Dashboard (Commonwealth Bank): I used Splunk to create a dashboard that visualized fraud patterns based on age, gender, category, and merchants, improving fraud detection and reporting.

*  Phishing Incident Response: I analyzed a phishing attack, isolated affected systems, reset credentials, and recommended post-incident measures such as system reviews and employee training to prevent future attacks.

*  Password Security Awareness Infographic: I designed a clear, visually appealing infographic using ACSC guidelines, emphasizing strong password creation and management tips for employees.

*  Penetration Testing: I identified vulnerabilities, and compiled a report with findings and recommendations to secure web applications.

These tasks strengthened my ability to detect fraud, respond to security incidents, raise awareness, and identify vulnerabilities in web systems.
