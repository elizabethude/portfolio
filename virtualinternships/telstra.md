In my experience responding to a malware attack, I first triaged the alert received at the Security Operation Centre (SOC), quickly contacting the appropriate team to initiate a response. This involved honing my skills in incident detection, communication, and teamwork.

Next, I analyzed the attack data to identify malware spread patterns, enabling me to develop an effective firewall rule. This task sharpened my abilities in network analysis and data interpretation.

Using Python, I then crafted a firewall rule to technically mitigate the malware's spread, enhancing my software development and problem-solving skills.

Finally, I conducted a postmortem, reflecting on the incident's details, root causes, and compliance implications. This wrap-up reinforced my understanding of incident management strategies and governance.
