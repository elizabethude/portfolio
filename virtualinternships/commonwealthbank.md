I began by revising the fundamentals of cybersecurity and learning about various cyber threats such as phishing and malware. 
I identified security risks, conducted assessments on fictional organizations, and prioritized vulnerabilities to enhance my risk management skills.
Additionally, I implemented security measures like firewalls and encryption protocols, emphasizing the importance of a multi-layered security approach.
